# Programming experiments
## 1. Set up Matlab
## 2. Generate Experimental Design
- make a matrix with all the information needed for the trial in every row
## 3. Main Experimental Loop over Design
- iterate over rows of design
- typically present pictures and record reaction times or eye movements
## 4. Close everything and write to file
## 5. Integrate Eyelink
